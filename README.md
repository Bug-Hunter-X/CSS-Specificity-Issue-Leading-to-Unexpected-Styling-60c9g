# CSS Specificity Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue in CSS: unexpected styling due to specificity conflicts.

## Bug Description

A more specific CSS selector unintentionally overrides a less specific one, leading to incorrect styling.

## Bug Solution

The solution involves carefully reviewing the CSS selectors and using the `!important` flag judiciously (though generally it is not recommended to overuse this technique.)  Alternatively, restructuring the CSS selectors to ensure that the intended styles are applied with proper specificity.
